### Testing

This folder contains files for testing video+FPGA+camera synchronization.
Folders are listed with n/Sync for the hardware used, where n is the number
of bits the hardware is designed to support.

DLP_Test_Settings.txt is also in the same folder, n, for configuring the DLP
to use n-bits
